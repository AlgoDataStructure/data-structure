# What is Complexity Analysis? Why it's needed?

The process of determining how efficient the algorithm is. Complexity analysis involves both Time and Space Complexities of an Algorithm.

It's needed to determine the better algorithm for the purpose.

It is classified into 3 types.

1. Best Case - Big Omega
2. Medium Case - Big Theta
3. Worst Case - Big O
